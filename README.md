The following are the steps performed to produce the tidy data set

Download unzipped files
Load required data sets (features, activity_labels, and training & test set)
Only focus on measurements that contain Mean and Standard Deviation
Rename the columns with the correct column names for both training and test data sets
Merge the three files for training set into single file. Do the same for the test set
Also for variable names, change the abbreviations into a more appropriate name (for example, t into time, f into frequency, etc)
Product tidy data with the mean for all the measurements based on subjectID and activityID
Write the data set as output
